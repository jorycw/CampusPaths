# Tests adding multiple edges from a single node, 
# including one to itself, then prints edges out. 

# Create graphs
created graph graph1
created graph graph2

# Adds 3 different nodes to graph1
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1
added node n3 to graph1

# Adds 3 different nodes to graph2
added node m1 to graph2
added node m2 to graph2
added node m3 to graph2

# Adds 4 edges to graph1
added edge toMyself from n1 to n1 in graph1
added edge n1TOn3 from n1 to n3 in graph1
added edge xtran1TOn3 from n1 to n3 in graph1
added edge whyNotAddN2 from n1 to n2 in graph1

# Adds 3 edges to graph 2
added edge sameNames from m1 to m3 in graph2
added edge sameNames from m1 to m2 in graph2
added edge notAChildofN1 from m2 to m1 in graph2

# Prints Edges of n1 in graph1 and m1 in graph2
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n1(toMyself) n2(whyNotAddN2) n3(n1TOn3) n3(xtran1TOn3)
the children of m1 in graph2 are: m2(sameNames) m3(sameNames)
