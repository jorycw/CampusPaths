# Testing file.
# Tests listing back children in  a graph, both with no children,
# and children alphabetically (first by node name and then edge label)

# Create graph
created graph graph1

# Adds 3 nodes to graph1
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1
added node n3 to graph1

# Lists children of a node with no children in graph1
the children of n1 in graph1 are:

# Adds 3 different children to n1, including itself
added edge myself from n1 to n1 in graph1
added edge to2 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge to3 from n1 to n3 in graph1

# Lists children of node n1 in graph1
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n1(myself) n2(to2) n3(to3)

# Add 4 more edges to graph1 that are close in string comparison by label
added edge meself from n1 to n1 in graph1
added edge 4me from n1 to n1 in graph1
added edge notMyself from n1 to n1 in graph1
added edge lIsBeforeM from n1 to n1 in graph1

# Lists children of node n1 in graph1
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n1(4me) n1(lIsBeforeM) n1(meself) n1(myself) n1(notMyself) n2(to2) n3(to3)
