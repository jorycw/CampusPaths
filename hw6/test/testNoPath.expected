# Simple test of breadth-first search algorithm.
# Verifies that it correctly indicates when there is no path found
# between two nodes. This can be the case when there exists no edges
# between the two nodes or when the direction of the edges don't allow
# for a path from the first node to the second (note for marvel paths
# all paths (edges) will always be two sided)

created graph characters
added node A to characters
added node B to characters
added node C to characters

path from A to C:
no path found

added edge A2B from A to B in characters
added edge C2B from C to B in characters

path from A to C:
no path found

added node D to characters
added edge B2D from B to D in characters

path from A to D:
A to B via A2B
B to D via B2D
path from D to A:
no path found
