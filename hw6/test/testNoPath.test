# Simple test of breadth-first search algorithm.
# Verifies that it correctly indicates when there is no path found 
# between two nodes. This can be the case when there exists no edges
# between the two nodes or when the direction of the edges don't allow
# for a path from the first node to the second (note for marvel paths
# all paths (edges) will always be two sided)
