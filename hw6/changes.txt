I changed my implementation of my Graph class from a List of Nodes which
contained a List of edges going out from them to a Map that mapped each Node
(as a String) to a Set of its Edges.  These implementations are very
similar in design but the latter is much faster.  Storing the nodes
in an arrayList isn't efficient in adding many nodes due to resizing
and HashSets aren't as good as HashMaps for accessing a certain node
to get its edges. A HashMap of Strings to Sets of Edges outperformed
Lists and Sets heavily.

Due to the similarities the ADT and AF had to be barely changed.  The 
representation invariant had to be checked slightly different but is still
the same by design and much smaller due to some of the properties being
inherent now i.e.(I can't have duplicate edges anymore now that edges are
stored in a hashSet).  Other methods and tests were adjusted to reflect this
new implementation and the node and nodeTest class were deleted.
