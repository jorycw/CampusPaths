# Find a path with Dijkstra's algorithm when there are two distinct paths
# in which the path containing more edges has a lower cost

created graph graph
added node a to graph
added node b to graph
added node c to graph
added node d to graph

added node a.5 to graph

added edge 0.200 from a to a.5 in graph
added edge 0.100 from a.5 to b in graph
added edge 2.200 from b to d in graph

added edge 2.000 from a to c in graph
added edge 2.000 from c to d in graph

path from a to d:
a to a.5 with weight 0.200
a.5 to b with weight 0.100
b to d with weight 2.200
total cost: 2.500
