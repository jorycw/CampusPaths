# Find a path with Dijkstra's algorithm when there are two distinct paths
# in which both contain two edges, but one has a lower cost

created graph graph
added node a to graph
added node b to graph
added node c to graph
added node d to graph

added edge 0.500 from a to b in graph
added edge 3.600 from b to d in graph

added edge 2.000 from a to c in graph
added edge 2.000 from c to d in graph

path from a to d:
a to c with weight 2.000
c to d with weight 2.000
total cost: 4.000
